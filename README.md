A cross-platform, minimalist web framework for [PowerShell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell).

## Disclaimer

Polaris is currently an **unsupported, experimental, proof-of-concept**. There is no current plan to turn it into a supported Microsoft product.

That being said, we do plan on continuing to experiment within this repository for the foreseeable future.

## Example

```PowerShell
New-PolarisGetRoute -Path "/helloworld" -Scriptblock {
    $Response.Send('Hello World!');
}

Start-Polaris
```

### Why yet another web framework for PowerShell?

There have been a great list of [other](https://github.com/StartAutomating/Pipeworks)Â [micro](https://github.com/toenuff/flancy) [web](https://github.com/Jaykul/NancyPS/) [frameworks](https://github.com/toenuff/PshOdata) [written](https://github.com/straightdave/presley) [over](https://github.com/cofonseca/WebListener) [the](https://github.com/DataBooster/PS-WebApi) [years](https://github.com/ChristopherGLewis/PowerShellWebServers) (Thanks @jaykul for the list!).

Polaris' differentiation is that it is cross-platform and uses the .NET HttpListener class.

## Getting Started

### Prereqs

- [PowerShell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell)

### Steps

#### From the [PowerShell Gallery](https://powershellgallery.com)

```powershell
PS > Install-Module Polaris
```

You can now try out the [example above](#example) or checkout [the site](https://PowerShell.github.io/Polaris) for more usage information!

#### From source

1. Clone or download the zip of the repo
1. Open [PowerShell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell)
1. At this point, you can now run `Import-Module ./Polaris.psd1`

You can now try out the [example above](#example) or checkout [the site](https://PowerShell.github.io/Polaris) for more usage!

You can also run all the Pester tests by running `Invoke-Pester` in the `test` directory. You will need [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester) version [4.1.0](https://github.com/pester/Pester/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#410-november-15-2017) or higher to run the tests on Linux or MacOS.

## Troubleshooting / Questions

**Twitter:** #PSPolaris
**Slack:** See us in the #Polaris channel of the [PowerShell Slack](http://slack.poshcode.org/)
**GitHub Issues:** Submit a bug / new feature idea / or just a question as a new GitHub issue

## Roadmap

We have a few paths we are interested in taking. We hope the community helps direct us.

- Expanding on the current implementation using HttpListener to deliver features you'd expect from projects ASP.NET or Expressjs (route parameters, query parameters, middleware, auth etc)

- Investigating the use of [Kestrel](https://github.com/aspnet/KestrelHttpServer)/[ASP.NET Routing](https://github.com/aspnet/routing) instead of HttpListener

- Creating a routing domain-specific language (DSL) for isolating and running script blocks as routes. Drawing inspiration from [Pester](https://github.com/pester/Pester/).

## Feedback

This project is an experiment that has the possibility to grow into something great.
We can't do that without great feedback from you.
